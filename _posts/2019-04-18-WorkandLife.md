## Resilience(恢复能力) is About Your Recharge, Not how you Endure

1. Even worse, after refreshing our email or reading the same studies over and over, we are too exhausted when we land to soldier on the emails that have inevitably piled up.

2. We often make a militaristic "tough" approach to resilience and determination like a Marine pull himself through the mud, a boxer going one more round, a football player picking himself up off the ground for one more play.
We belive the longer we tough ourselves up, the tougher we are, and therefore the more sucessful we will be. However this entire conception is scientifically inaccurate.

3. And just because work stops, it doesn't mean we are recovering. We stop work sometimes at 5pm, but then we spend the night wrestling solution with work problems, talking about our work over dinner, and falling asleep thinking how much work we will done tomorrow.

4. If you really want to build resilience, you can strategically stopping.
